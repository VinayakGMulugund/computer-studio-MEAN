# Computer Studio Ecommerce Platform

## Overview

This project is an Ecommerce platform focused on building and managing computer configurations and their association with orders and carts. The platform uses Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL as the database. It includes a RESTful API to manage users, products, computers, studios, carts, and orders.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
